        <p>
          This was a Windows application I built using Flutter and Typescript. Features include authentication, sales
          and product shipments&apos; invoice generation, along with sales data, customer, product, and stock
          management, and automated monthly reports.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most challenging part of this one was that this was my first experience handling a freelance project. I
          had to consult directly with the client, mapping business into project requirements, managing project
          timelines, and programming the actual software.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately, I have experience in managing and splitting tasks at work using GitHub Projects (although there
          was no requirement to do so). This I did since I had found myself being constantly overwhelmed by unclear
          requirements and tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second most challenging part was printing hard copied invoices using dot matrix printers - of which I had
          no experience doing. In the end, what I did was generating the invoice as HTML on the server, converting it
          into PDF, and then sending a PowerShell command to print using the default PDF reader.
        </p>
        <p>
          All in all, I learned a lot in managing project timelines, creating and managing database backups, re-learned
          database migrations, and, of course, time management, since I had to work on the project outside of working
          hours.

          Deno is a JS runtime which has the tagline &quot;Uncomplicate JavaScript&quot;. And I think it did just that -
          at least in my simple project. Not having to deal with configuring code formatters, linters, and having a
          relatively concise code base was very nice!

          I find myself in constant needs of finding word definitions and wanted a simple way to do so (can always
